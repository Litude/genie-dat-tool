For overlay borders only first 4 are used:
0. NW
1. NE
2. SW
3. SE

For regular borders, all 12 are used:
0. W, N, S
1. W, N, E
2. W, E, S
3. N, E, S
4. W
5. N
6. S
7. E
8. W, N
9. E, S
10. W, S
11. N, E

Borders are 4 bits (16 posibilities), but the following are disallowed so we end up with just 12 possibilities:
- No need to consider case with no borders (removes 1 possibility)
- No need to consider case with all borders (removes 1 possibility)... Perhaps MICKEY.DAT included this shape?
- No need to consider case with opposite borders (removes 4 possibilities)


Seems like overlays had support for all 16 possibilities
